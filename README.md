# franchise
A LHOS single-unit franchisee will not require a physical place. Most franchisees hire teachers who subsequently travel to various places (schools, birthday parties, summer & holiday camps, fairs, etc.) to educate our exceptional systems. Many franchisees would not have to be concerned about the extra overhead which is done with a physical building by giving outreach systems.
